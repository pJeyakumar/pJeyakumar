### who am i? 🧐
My name is Piranavan Jeyakumar (good luck pronouncing that), Im quite an extroverted person (but still somehow very introverted on social media), I love to play sports with friends (volleyball, badminton, soccer, tennis, & basketball), and I'm also big on playing games & watching tv shows/anime. I'm also quite decent at looking things in a very logical lens & breaking down issues into manageable and solvable pieces (which is why I love walking down the path of Computer Scientists).
- Favourite Sport: Volleyball 🏐 (even though Im awful at it)
- Favourite Games: [Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater](https://metalgear.fandom.com/wiki/Metal_Gear_Solid_3:_Snake_Eater), [The Great Ace Attorney](https://www.ace-attorney.com/great1-2/en-asia/), [Hollow Knight](https://hollowknight.fandom.com/wiki/Hollow_Knight_Wiki), & [Hades](https://hades.fandom.com/wiki/Hades_(game)) 🎮
- Favourite TV Show: Avatar the Last Airbender (no question about it) 💧 🪨 🔥 💨
- Favourite Animes: Mushishi, Cowboy Bebop, March Comes Like a Lion, Mob Psycho 100, Megalo Box 2: Nomad, Vivy Fluorite Eyes Song, Violet Evergarden, Full Metal Alchemist: Brotherhood, & the list just keeps going...
