### a **Piranavan** guide 📙
I'm most effective with a gentle nudge in the right direction at the beginning. Show me the right way and I'll follow through (within reason) to a job well-done.

I thrive off of criticism and constructive feedback. I know there's a lot that I need to learn and that there's always room for improvement. I prefer concise and straight-forward feedback, not a huge fan of sugar-coating. I like to clearly know what is going well and what needs to be worked on.

Active communication and collaboration is very valuable to me, whether it be through messaging, video calls, and phone calls. I prefer these methods of communication because they're dynamic and it's easier to get a proper response compared to back and forth emails.

Occasional meetings are a must for me, in-person or remote. I enjoy having conversations with others, and I find that meetings work better than messaging.
