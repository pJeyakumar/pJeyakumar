### who am i? 🧐
My name is Piranavan Jeyakumar (good luck pronouncing that), Im quite an extroverted person (but still somehow very introverted on social media), I love to play sports with friends (volleyball, badminton, soccer, tennis, & basketball), and I'm also big on playing games & watching tv shows/anime. I'm also quite decent at looking things in a very logical lens & breaking down issues into manageable and solvable pieces (which is why I love walking down the path of Computer Scientists).
- Favourite Sport: Volleyball 🏐 (even though Im awful at it)
- Favourite Games: [Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater](https://metalgear.fandom.com/wiki/Metal_Gear_Solid_3:_Snake_Eater), [The Great Ace Attorney](https://www.ace-attorney.com/great1-2/en-asia/), [Hollow Knight](https://hollowknight.fandom.com/wiki/Hollow_Knight_Wiki), & [Hades](https://hades.fandom.com/wiki/Hades_(game)) 🎮
- Favourite TV Show: Avatar the Last Airbender (no question about it) 💧 🪨 🔥 💨
- Favourite Animes: Mushishi, Cowboy Bebop, March Comes In Like a Lion, Mob Psycho 100, Megalo Box 2: Nomad, Vivy Fluorite Eyes Song, Violet Evergarden, Full Metal Alchemist: Brotherhood, & the list just keeps going...

### a **Piranavan** guide 📙
- I'm most effective with a gentle nudge in the right direction at the beginning. Show me the right way and I'll follow through (with reason) to a job well-done.
- I thrive off of criticism and constructive feedback. I know there's a lot I need to learn, there's always room for improvement. I personally prefer concise and straight-forward feedback, not a huge fan of sugar-coating. I like to clearly know what is going well and what needs to be worked on.
- Active communication is very valuable to me, whether it be through Slack, Google Meets, or phone calls. I prefer these methods of communication because they're dynamic and it's easier to get a proper response compared to back and forth emails. 
- Occasional meetings are a must for me, in-person or remote, I enjoy having conversations with others, and I find that meetings work better than messaging.
